# GH Action to Build Docker Images (with some Keptn internal stuff)
![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/keptn/gh-action-build-docker-image)

This repo provides a utility GitHub action for the [CI Workflow](https://github.com/keptn/keptn/tree/master/.github/workflows) in the [Keptn Project](https://github.com/keptn). Nevertheless, this action provides a very basic functionality, as in "Build a docker image and do some sanity checks".

## Inputs

* `IMAGE_NAME` - name of the image (including the docker organization)
* `DOCKER_FOLDER` (optional, defaults to './') - folder where Dockerfile is in; needs a trailing slash
* `VERSION` - semantic version used as the tag for the resulting image
* `DATETIME` (optional) - in case you want to build multiple images and refer to them with the same datetime string, e.g., YYYYMMDDHHmmss; (defaults to `DATETIME=$(date +'%Y%m%d%H%M')`) 
* `FILE` (optional, defaults to 'Dockerfile') - name of the Dockerfile

## Outputs

None at the moment

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - id: docker_login
        name: Docker Login
        uses: docker/login-action@v1

### Extended Example

```
    env:
      VERSION: "1.2.3"
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - id: docker_login
        name: Docker Login
        # only run docker login on pushes; also for PRs, but only if this is not a fork
        if: (github.event_name == 'push') || (github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name == github.repository)
        # note: GH does not allow to access secrets for PRs from a forked repositories due to security reasons
        # that's fine, but it means we can't push images to dockerhub
        uses: docker/login-action@v1
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_USER }}
          password: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_PASSWORD }}
